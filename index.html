                        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world

                <li>1)
                    Gandhi played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule. His philosophy of nonviolent resistance, or Satyagraha, encouraged millions of Indians to participate in peaceful protests and demonstrations against British oppression, leading to significant international attention and support for the Indian independence movement.


                </li>
                <li>2)
                    Gandhi was an ardent advocate for peace and nonviolence. His views on conflict resolution and pacifism resonated with people around the world, particularly during times of war and social unrest. He often spoke out against violence and actively worked towards peaceful resolutions to conflicts.
                </li>
                <li>3)
                    Gandhi received support from various international personalities and organizations. Many influential figures, including Albert Einstein, expressed admiration for his ideas and principles. The Indian independence movement received support from global sympathizers who empathized with the cause of self-determination.
                </li>
                <li>
                    4)
                    Gandhi's international success can be attributed to his unwavering commitment to nonviolence, his ability to mobilize people from all walks of life, and his powerful messages that transcended national boundaries. He remains an iconic figure in the history of international movements for peace, justice, and human rights.
